 abstract = {In recent years, the ultra-high frequency (UHF) band from 470-862 MHz has been subject to several changes in frequency allocation, and a final decision for new services is still under discussion. Until 2010, this band was exclusively assigned to stations for terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) [1]. The current demand for ever increasing data rates for mobile devices has led to changes in frequency range assignments. The key term "digital dividend" is frequently used by regulatory bodies and well-known in the cognitive radio community. In its first rollout, the band from 790-862 MHz was brought up for auction to mobile network operators in Germany [2]. The total revenue for 60 MHz of spectrum was USD 3,575 billion [2], [3], which underlines the great market value of the radio spectrum.},

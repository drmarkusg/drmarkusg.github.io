However, together with an increase of hardware capabilities such as higher carrier frequencies, modulation bandwidths and ramp slopes, as well as a scaling up of simultaneously utilized transmit and receive channels with independent modulation features, new degrees of freedom have been added to traditional FMCW radar system design and signal processing. The anticipated presentation will accordingly introduce the topic with a review on the fundamentals of radar and FMCW radar. After introducing the system architecture of traditional and modern automotive FMCW radar sensors, with e.g. insights into the concepts of distributed or centralized processing and sensor data fusion, the presentation will dive into the details of fast-chirp FMCW processing – the modulation mode which is used by the vast majority of current automotive FMCW radar systems. Starting with the fundamentals of target range and velocity estimation based on the radar data matrix, the spatial dimension available using modern single-input multiple-output (SIMO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems will be introduced and radar processing based on the radar data cube is discussed. Of interest is the topic of angular resolution – one of the key drawbacks which e.g. render Lidar systems superior to radar in some situations. Consequently, traditional and modern methods for direction of arrival estimation in FMCW radar systems are presented, starting from traditional monopulse-like algorithms to modern frameworks for superresolution DoA estimation. The presentation will then introduce the great challenge of FMCW radar system interference. While FMCW radar interference is a challenge which can be handled using adaptive signal processing in today’s systems, it will become a severe problem with the increasing number of radar-sensors equipped vehicles in dense traffic situations in the near future and a solution to the expected increase in interference is still an open question.  It is this problem of interference, together with some added functionality, which motivated the proposal of alternative radar waveforms such as pseudo-random or orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) radar for automotive radar systems. Although not yet of great interest from an industrial perspective, the fundamentals and capabilities of both technologies will be introduced in the remainder of the anticipated presentation.","tags":[],"title":"Distinguished Microwave Lecture: Automotive Radar - A Signal Processing Perspective on Current Technology and Future Systems","type":"talk"},{"authors":["J.

Until 2010, this band was exclusively assigned to stations for terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) [1]. The current demand for ever increasing data rates for mobile devices has led to changes in frequency range assignments. The key term \"digital dividend\" is frequently used by regulatory bodies and well-known in the cognitive radio community. In its first rollout, the band from 790-862 MHz was brought up for auction to mobile network operators in Germany [2]. The total revenue for 60 MHz of spectrum was USD 3,575 billion [2], [3], which underlines the great market value of the radio spectrum.","tags":[],"title":"Let's Make Them Cognitive Cognitive Radio Technology Applied to Professional Wireless Microphone Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matej Kloc","Norman Franchi","Markus Gardill","Robert Weigel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451602800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451602800,"objectID":"bfffaa65dd43594d327461d1095653d0","permalink":"drmarkusg.github.io/publication/kloc-low-2016/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"drmarkusg.github.io/publication/kloc-low-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Low latency and highest transmission reliability are the key challenges for enabling time-critical industrial wireless applications, e.g. in factory automation.

In order to get these influences under control, a novel concept for an adaptive and low latency (≤ 1 ms) industrial wireless communications (IWC) system that adopts a robust IEEE 802.11p physical layer (PHY) is proposed and evaluated.

Although the techniques developed in this work are not limited to a certain application scenario, in particular the design of a four-element uniform linear and four-element uniform circular array antenna is considered. The antenna arrays are used for implementing direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in a novel UWB secondary RADAR system for industrial local positioning applications.  The system's frequency range is from 6 GHz to 9 GHz and hence possesses a relative bandwidth of 40 %. State of the art industrial FMCW RADAR systems in contrast traditionally operate in the narrowband regime with relative bandwidths much smaller than 10 %. In consequence methods traditionally used for characterizing the antennas, for modeling the influence of the an- tennas on the RADAR system performance, for implementing direction-of-arrival estimation in FMCW RADAR systems, and for designing antenna arrays are not sufficient. Their application to UWB FMCW RADAR systems is carefully reviewed, and where necessary extended to take into account effects emerging due to the large relative bandwidth.  In particular an exact model for the received intermediate-frequency (IF) signal of a multi-channel UWB FMCW RADAR system employing an array of ideal point sensors is developed first. Approximations are then applied to the exact model until a suitable description for developing DOA estimation algorithms in the UWB FMCW RADAR system is achieved. It is further shown how this model is related to the narrowband models used for DOA estimation in traditional multi-channel FMCW RADAR systems. Subsequently refined beamforming algorithms based on the approaches of Bartlett and Capon, which take into account the received IF signal of the UWB FMCW sensor array, are proposed. Those algorithms are further extended to allow for simultaneous DOA and range estimation. A careful comparison of the refined algorithms with the traditional algorithms is used to demonstrate their superior performance in UWB FMCW RADAR systems. In addition it is shown that a sensor element spacing larger than the traditionally known limit may be used, which simplifies the design of UWB array antennas.  The proposed models based on ideal sensor elements are then extended to take into account the simulated or measured characteristics of realistic antennas. Therefore, state-of-the-art methods for the characterization of isolated UWB antenna elements are used. Those methods are then refined to provide the necessary characterization of small array antennas, in particular including the effects of mutual coupling. Based on the antenna characterization, a simplified comprehensive model is developed which allows for taking into account the antenna array characteristics into the output of a multi-channel UWB FMCW RADAR system. This enables for directly assessing the influence of the antennas onto the performance of signal processing algorithms already during antenna development.  Finally a four-element uniform linear and a four-element uniform circular array antenna are designed for the local positioning application. The linear array antenna employs a novel method referred to as column-coupling for achieving the desired characteristics in the frequency range from 6 GHz to 9 GHz. The circular antenna array is optimized for vehicle rooftop integration and is based on mechanically robust Monocone antenna elements.","tags":[],"title":"Characterization and design of small array antennas for direction-of-arrival estimation for ultra-wideband industrial FMCW radar systems","type":"publication"}]
